#Photolotus

This app allows you to create an account, upload an image, and save that image to your profile. 

After signing in, you are able to access our main page, where you can upload a photo of your choice 
and come back later to see what you have uploaded. 

We store your photos in an easy to use way so that you can always look back at your memories with ease on 
any of your devices with internet access.

Upcoming features include the ability to save photos to different albums, and further customization of your saved 
images.
